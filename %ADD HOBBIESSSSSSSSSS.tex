    \item {\fontsize{10.5}{12.6} \selectfont Performed a variety of tasks from testing to developing with minimal supervision which required me to grow strong communication, interpersonal and debugging skills.
	\item Integrated new serialization approach (Google Protocol Buffers) instead of json serilization, increasing time and memory efficiency while supporting the existing code in two distributed systems.
	\item Worked with C\# and Python.
	\item Being in an agile environment required me to familiarize myself with version control (Microsoft Azure in specific) and it's best practices.
	\item Being in an agile environment required me to follow coding practices such as test driven development and pair programming.}
